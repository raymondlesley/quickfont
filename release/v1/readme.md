# Version "1"

This is probably the first version that I found later when recovering an 
earlier tape. This is dated 6-30-84 without a version number. Of course,
it is quite a bit smaller as it is pretty basic. It also asks for the
memory address of the font, which in later versions, I fixed at 64600
unless you edit the line near the top of the code. With it, I found a 
font that had a load address of 768 bytes below 63222, which is the address
for TASWIDE, so I must have been having custom fonts for 32 column normal
text along with TASWIDE for 64 column text.
